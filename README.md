# Auditory Steady State Evoked Potentials

The ability to pay attention to internal body sensations coming from detectors located on the internal organs of the body (interoception) has an effect on emotional responses, and emotional regulation abilities.

Shifting between external stimuli and internal signals are necessary for adaptive emotion regulation and psychological well-being, and difficulties in performing this conversion are associated with depression and anxiety disorders.

However, there are still no good objective tools to quantify how a person drives attention between external and internal stimuli and what is his ability to bring significant internal attention.

We want to measure attention changes on the internal-external axis and their nervousness correlations in order to advance the understanding of regulatory processes and related psychopathologies.
